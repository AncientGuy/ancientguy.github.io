# Program Yourself

#### STOP being programmed carelessly ...you do not have to be a gadget running somebody else's app...

... *you don't have to be somebody else's W2 slave, somebody else's bitch* ... but being powerless, defenseless, or controlled by others is the only possible result when you program yourself to be another *customer* enslaved by your purchases or another materialist dead-ender *owned* by your assets.

OWN, don't BE the lost soul who is owned. Come up with your OWN programming ... put together your own list. It's on you to...**DEVELOP Your Life**

## Christian Development & Community Service

### 0. LISTEN TO YOURSELF!
Your body, your mind, your soul are attempting to repeat what God is trying to tell your old, fossilized ass. LISTEN TO YOURSELF! Mostly, your soul has to come first. Understand what this means for you; take time to contemplate ways that make you pay attention to your SOUL ... *some guys need time in prison to accomplish this feat* ... hopefully, you won't need that. But if you consistenly put yourself and your pile of assets, relationships, acquistions first, then you will belong in prison. Remember where **J-O-Y** comes from. J is for Jesus, FIRST! Then O for Other principles, Other causes, maybe the Oath you took to support and defend the Constitution, Y is for You and me -- *love all humans as you love yourself*, but humans come AFTER your Creator, AFTER higher principles. Internalize [Mark 8:34-38](https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/8/Mark-chapter-8.html) and stop trifling away your life chasing wealth, power, status or even more idiotic human pursuits such as being *liked* by nice humans. After your soul, care for your MIND -- it does NOT need to relax; it NEEDS the aggravation of growth, the challenge of learning. Stop looking back! Time does not work that way. Instead of being an irrelevant senile geezer longing for the rearview mirror, try to LEARN as much as you can in order to grow. Try to NOT be just another OLD fossilized, ecocentric *specialist,* taking pride in your professional reputation ... *nobody cares about your reputation -- they will and should care even less when you make an issue of defending it*. Finally, listen to your BODY; loving your body means USING it; your body knows why "Discipline Equals Freedom." It's time for you to ignore fitness gadgets or apps, and LISTEN in order to develop your body awareness. Of course, extreme minimalism bordering on austere asceticism will help you to listen, because if you really want to listen to yourself, it is important to **remove all of the materialist noise!**

The minimal-equipment nature of basic sound mapping aligns with simplicity principles. The contrast with recorded audio consumption provides perspective on direct versus mediated sonic experience.

### 98. Starlight Reading
Developing night vision through reading by only starlight and moonlight builds sensory capacity without requiring artificial illumination. The neurological adaptation involved creates visual sensitivity transferable to all low-light navigation. Regular night reading builds patience through adjusted pace necessary in natural darkness. The Biblical imagery of light and darkness provides theological depth to this practice. The energy independence of star-reading creates resilience impossible through technology-dependent illumination. The sensory challenge involved provides neurological stimulation beyond convenience-oriented activities. The zero-energy requirement aligns perfectly with simplicity and stewardship principles. The contrast with screen reading provides perspective on natural versus artificial visual processing.

### 99. Forest Bathing Practice
Engaging in mindful immersion in natural environments builds stress reduction and immune enhancement without requiring special equipment or locations. The multi-sensory engagement creates neurological integration impossible through single-sense dominated activities. Regular nature immersion builds subtle perception of environmental patterns often missed during goal-directed outdoor activities. The Biblical creation narrative provides theological foundation for nature appreciation and communion. The physiological benefits documented in research include reduced stress hormones, improved immune function and enhanced mood regulation. The zero-equipment nature of forest bathing makes it perfectly aligned with simplicity principles. The contrast with indoor-only recreation provides perspective on natural versus artificial experience.

### 100. Sacred Space Creation
Designating and maintaining a simple area for prayer and meditation builds spiritual focus without requiring elaborate furnishings or decorations. The intentional arrangement involved creates environmental support for contemplative practice often lacking in multi-purpose spaces. Regular sacred space use builds transition capacity between worldly and spiritual attention that enhances prayer depth. The Biblical precedent of set-apart places provides theological foundation for dedicated prayer spaces. The sensory minimalism creates attentional restoration impossible in visually cluttered environments. The minimal-resource approach using existing items aligns perfectly with simplicity principles. The contrast with consumption-based spirituality provides perspective on presence versus acquisition in devotional life.
