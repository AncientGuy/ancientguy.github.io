# Christian Spiritual Health

#### A Contemplative Framework for Self-Development

## Core Principle: Discerning the Will of the Creator

As you improve your spiritual fitness, you **focus upon discerning the will of your Creator** rather than focusing too heavily on immediate anxieties, fears, and noise. For some, this language—*discerning the will of your Creator*—is problematic, perhaps because the language is too anthropomorphic. So don't make your Creator in your tiny, insignificant image. 

The point is to zoom your thinking way, way, WAY out beyond human-centric petty wants and needs or human-centric navel-gazing, to zoom your physical box of situational awareness dimensionally out beyond your geographic confines to see the world from deep outer space, to zoom your conception of time beyond the moment or your immediate concerns and to view time from the perspective of tens of thousands of years.

### The Foundation of Spiritual Fitness

**The REASON that SPIRITUAL fitness matters more than all other forms of fitness combined is that the Creator is still creating.**

Embrace the will of the Creator. Err on the side of trying to observe and understand, rather than being so defensive and reactionary—embrace the suck, embrace the disappointment from humans, embrace the humility, embrace being unappreciated or taken for granted, because humans CANNOT understand the nature of God.

GOD NEVER WENT ON VACATION and never will. You were created in God's image—you do not get to create God in your image. That means see the big picture... that means that you are to trust that your instincts will allow you to defend yourself and react appropriately, i.e., you will still swat mosquitoes; when your hand is on a warming stove, you will need to move it or get burned... but you don't need to flail about dramatically like some flighty prey animal—you can ditch the drama and behave like an apex predator.

That's what the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ was about.

## Part VI: The Way of Development

### Developing Our Lives Through Distributed Self-Governance

The best method to develop our lives is through distributed self-governance based upon life lived per the example of Jesus Christ. This requires:

1. **Autodidactic Education**: Learning to educate oneself prevents slavery to others' thinking
2. **Sovereign Authority**: Refusing to abdicate individual responsibility
3. **Informed Living**: Using tools and technologies judiciously while avoiding dependence
4. **Programmed Development**: Choosing what shapes and forms our thinking

### The Discipline of Non-Comparison

The way of spiritual maturity captures the eternal ideal of Jesus Christ's life example, because that way is to never be distracted by comparisons or what others are doing—to ONLY seek the will of the Creator. 

We are blessed to live in an age where we get to use ridiculously capable technologies to program ourselves. It's *GET TO*, not *have to*. So with gratitude, you can choose to **PROGRAM YOURSELF**.

### Resistance to False Programming

The conventional wisdom or all of the stuff you're being told is not just mostly wrong and possibly bad for you; there's a good chance that the message was crafted and tailored for you to make you feel powerless.

**Stop** watching or believing movies. **Stop** being programmed by fake stories, fake actors, fake images. **Start** controlling how you are programmed. 

You cannot really resist being programmed or shaped by what you consume—you are what you eat, in every sense of the word. But you can be more mindful as you focus on discerning the will of the Creator and ask the Lord to bless each morsel you consume with reverence and appreciation for how it helps you become the being the Creator intended.

### The Call to Sovereignty

**You must REFUSE to abdicate your sovereign individual authority.** 

It's on YOU to develop the capability to wield information technology in a manner that actually gives you something approaching TRUE information. Information never comes in the form of an easy answer or a nice story—information, like opportunity, shows up looking like work and something that unsettles you and tells you that you have to get after the task of gathering intelligence and fighting for your independence as a sovereign individual, as you were created.

### Recognizing Manipulation

**Refuse to be misled.** Remember that false prophets and engineers of fake information are exquisitely skilled in their craft, using *carrot and stick* to manipulate your thinking:

- The **carrot** approach makes you feel warm and fuzzy, entertained, or reassured
- The **stick** approach makes you question your faith, terrifies you, or beats you down into powerlessness

Both approaches aim to get you to abdicate your sovereign authority as an independent, informed, mindful individual, as you were created.

## Part VII: Questions for Church Community and Accountability

### For Small Group Discussion

1. **What is the biblical process for confronting another believer about their sin?**
   - *Matthew 18:15 (ESV): "If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault..."*

2. **What is church discipline and why is it necessary?**
   - *1 Corinthians 5:12-13 (ESV): "For what have I to do with judging outsiders?"*

3. **How should Christians handle disagreements over non-essential doctrines?**
   - *Romans 14:1 (ESV): "As for the one who is weak in faith, welcome him..."*

4. **What does the Bible say about gossip and slander?**
   - *Proverbs 16:28 (ESV): "A dishonest man spreads strife..."*

5. **What is the Great White Throne Judgment?**
   - *Revelation 20:11 (ESV): "Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it..."*

6. **Will animals be in the new creation?**
   - *Isaiah 11:6 (ESV): "The wolf shall dwell with the lamb..."*

## Conclusion: The Integration of All Things

As you develop this discipline of focusing upon discerning the will of your Creator, you will become much, much, MUCH less anxious. Long-term, massive reductions in anxiety are one way of knowing whether your approach is working. This is not like the temporary euphoria you might feel at a tent revival or life-changing event. This is a permanent, long-term, massive, and constantly improving reduction in anxiety.

With freedom from anxiety comes the ability to get off the hamster wheel and make smarter, more stable decisions, and to avoid blatantly stupid physical behaviors—using substances to relax, food as an emotional crutch, or thinking that you need constant escape.

The moments of your life program you to become you. It's up to you to control those moments and develop your life, avoiding junk objectives or becoming a slave to possessions that behave as liabilities. Develop only those aspects of life that perform as assets.

We are competing against our ideal selves, the perfect self that our Creator intended us to exhibit. This competition is impossibly daunting, and every day is full of failures. We can chase our ideal, we can rarely attain it even for moments, but it is completely impossible to attain when we compare ourselves to others or use any yardstick of materialist life as an indicator of success.

Christian spiritual health forms the cornerstone of holistic wellbeing, influencing all other aspects of life through prayer, scripture engagement, and spiritual practices. This contemplative framework encourages intentional spiritual development while recognizing the interconnected nature of spiritual health with all dimensions of life.
