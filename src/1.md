# Christian Spiritual Health

The believers in central government never acknowledge that governance must depend upon coercive, ultimately violent force ... therefore the best method is distributed self-governance based upon life lived per the example of Jesus Christ. In other words, ANY and ALL attempts to apply coercion are necessarily become domineering and then violent when that coercion is not self-applied. The NECESSARY understanding of self-applied coercion comes from autodidactic education -- if one can never learn to educate oneself, then one is doomed to be a slave to others and ultimately subvert one's thinking [based on the lived example of Jesus Christ] to will of the crowd. Thus, obedience to the will of the Lord demands having no other gods before God -- obedience to the will of the Lord is impossible to understand when one gets one's health, education and welfare from coercively obtained force of governments.

It's up to us to **DEVELOP our Lives** ... judiciously choosing and using the talents, tools, technologies that we have been blessed with ... we master and wield information technology in order to understand its danger and misuse, as you INFORM yourself.

I continually remind myself, "The moments of your life program you to become you."  It's up to you to control those moments and **DEVELOP Your Life** ... avoid pursuing junk objectives or becoming a slave to possessions that behave liabilities, ie demand continual attention or payment ... develop only those aspects of life that perform as assets ... you can use all of the relevant tools, technologies, talents that you are blessed with, but avoid the gadgets that only cost.

I know better, but I continually fail at this ... but failure's how we learn.

It is certainly not an easy task to develop one's life ... mainly because as humans, we are competing against our ideal selves, the perfect self that we could have been, with the perfect soul that our Creator intended us to exhibit. Of course, that competition is tough, impossibly daunting and every day is full of failures -- we can chase our ideal, we can rarely attain our ideal even for a few moments, but that is possible ... however, it is completely IMPOSSIBLE to attain one's ideal when one compares oneself to others -- the certain way to failure, although it can ***feel*** like measureable success, is to use any yardstick of materialist, affluent life as some indicator or measure of true success. 

The way of ANCIENT GUYS is ideal, because that way is to never be distracted by comparisons or what others are doing ... to ONLY seek the will of the Creator. So it can be extremely difficult and even painful ... but life is still a ridculous blessing ... we are BLESSED to live in an age where **we get to do things** like master and wield information technology in order to understand its danger and misuse, as you INFORM ourselves.  

**We GET TO use ridiculously capable technologies to program ourselves** ...it's *GET TO*, not have to ... so *WITH GRATITUDE* ... you can choose to **PROGRAM YOURSELF.**

#### The conventional wisdom or all of the stuff you're being told is not just mostly wrong and possibly bad for you, there's a good chance that the message was crafted and tailored for you to make you feel powerless.

Stop watching or believing movies. Stop being programmed by fake shit, fake stories, fake actors, fake images. Start controlling how you are programmed. You cannot really resist being programmed or shaped by what you consume ... you are what you eat, in every sense of the word ... and you know that you are not going to stop eating. But you can be more mindful as you focus on discerning the will of the Creator and ask the Lord to bless each morsel you consume and consume each bite with reverence and appreciation for how it helps you become the being the Creator intended that you become. You can ***exercise*** rather than atrophise -- that extends to *exercising* better control over the moments of your day. You can use information technology to prepare your OWN programming.

It's on you to **refuse to abdicate your sovereign authority to INFORM your life**. If you abdicate this authority, you give in to the thinking those who say that you're obsolete, (ie, those who say that AI will take jobs like your, then take lives like yours) or that that you're irrelevant, (ie, those who predict a world of superabundance, where machines handle Reality, while you get to handle the remote on your entertainment gadget or transportainment vehicle). 

**You must REFUSE to abidicate your sovereign individual authority.** It's on YOU to develop the capability to wield information technology in a manner that actually gives you something approaching TRUE information ... information NEVER EVER EVER has come in the form of an easy answer or a nice story -- information, like opportunity, shows up looking like working and something that unsettles you and tells you that you have to get after the task of gathering intelligence and fighting for your independence as a sovereign individual, as your were created. You were not created to abdicate -- you were created to fight, even though you might not immediately know how to fight ... what you must know that is that you must REFUSE to abidicate your sovereign individual authority.  

**Refuse to be misled**, remember that false prophets and engineers of fake information are exquisitely skilled in their craft, using something like *carrot and stick* to manipulate which direction your media pull your thinking. The *carrot* approach makes you feel *warm and fuzzy* or entertained or seduced by spectacle of the the Colosseum and its GOAT gladiators or to somehow reassuringly confirm what you have always believed. If you feel reassured or entertained or exuberant, you're probably drunk on *carrot* juice. The *stick* approach is designed to make you question your faith in God, to completely scare the shit out of you and require some immediate change in behavior or purchase of a comfort fix *bandaid* or to even terrify you so severely that you curl into a ball seeking distraction, busyness, numbness or drunkenness. If you are overcome by feelings of powerless and so beaten down that you can't hope to get up, you've been playing with the *stick* too much. Both the *carrot* and the *stick* and all other anti-agency approaches are about getting you to abdicate your sovereign authority as an independent informed mindful individual, as you were created.
