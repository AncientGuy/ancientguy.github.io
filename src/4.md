# Nutrition and Gardening

#### A Contemplative Framework for Physical and Spiritual Nourishment

## Core Principle: The Body as Temple, Food as Sacred Fuel

The nutrition section examines dietary patterns and habits that have evolved throughout one's life while exploring optimal macronutrient balance and micronutrient intake for aging bodies. For the most part, engage in a carnivorous ketogenic diet except that it should mimic the diet of the monastic community of Mount Athos. Produce L. reuteri yogurt/whey for one protein source but also to boost gut health. For fiber needs and variety, add in fresh produce from the garden and also frozen produce along with sprouts and microgreens when the garden is not available. Questions that one contemplates during eating should address practical aspects of meal planning, preparation strategies, and hydration practices, alongside psychological and social dimensions of eating. The section covers environmental and ethical considerations in food choices, digestive health issues, and food sensitivities that commonly develop with age. Special attention is given to nutritional approaches supporting longevity and healthy aging, with practical implementation strategies for continuous improvement. The reflective prompts encourage approaching nutrition as an act of stewardship for one's body rather than focusing solely on restriction or indulgence.

## Conclusion: The Lifelong Journey of Nutritional Wisdom

Nutrition transcends mere sustenanceâ€”it becomes an act of worship, discipline, and stewardship. Each food choice either builds or destroys the temple God has entrusted to us. The questions in this framework challenge conventional dietary dogma while encouraging a return to ancestral wisdom combined with modern metabolic understanding.

Remember: Your nutritional journey is unique. Some days you'll feel invincible on your chosen path; others will test your resolve. Both are part of the transformation. The key is consistency, wisdom, and the courage to reject cultural food norms that lead to disease.

The integration of scripture with nutrition reminds us that food has always been central to the human spiritual experienceâ€”from Eden's garden to the Last Supper. As we learn to eat with intention and wisdom, we develop discipline that extends far beyond the dinner table.

**Final Nutritional Challenges:**

1. **If your body is truly a temple, what are you offering on its altar?**
2. **Will you choose food that builds strength or accepts weakness?**
3. **What legacy will your nutritional choices leave for the next generation?**

*"Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your bodies." - 1 Corinthians 6:19-20*

The choice is before you. Not tomorrow. Not after the holidays. Not when it's convenient. Right now. Choose life. Choose strength. Choose wisdom. Your temple awaits its proper fuel.
