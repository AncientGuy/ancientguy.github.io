<p>The WHOLE POINT of this mdBook is to lay the groundwork for building a foundation model for holistic life AI.  In the realm of large language models (LLMs) and artificial intelligence (AI), a foundation model refers to a large deep learning neural network that has been trained on a massive and diverse dataset ... but we should understand that <em>massive and diverse</em> are loaded terms, to some extend ALL AI training datasets are necessarily finite and selected ... as Bayesians would say that this is just a matter of being honest about one's prior assumptions ... so the developed mdBook, or specifically the MarkDown files and hierarchy of this mdBook will form the basis of an opinionated training data set for building a foundation model for holistic life. This extensive pre-training equips the model with a broad understanding of patterns, structures, and representations across various domains, enabling it to be adapted for a range of tasks in offering AI assistance for holistic life ... the AncientGuy foundation model WILL be opiniated, but coldly realistic and not especially tolerant of much of the propaganda, noise and false information that is now part of the convention wisdom surrounding health and fitness information.</p>
<p>Never mind what you or your entire species thinks of its value or its accomplishments ... there are far, far, far bigger things than the tiny subset of Reality that humans can contemplate. That's true, even if we only look at grand sum total of everything that humans can appreciate in our known Universe. Obviously, there significantly bigger things, beyond anything than the human ego can appreciate ... the human mind is profoundly limited, to smaller degree by natural human limitations, ie a brain is finite, there are only so many neurons. MOST of the crippling limitations that constrain humans are self-imposed, by our tendency to cling to past experiences, favorite memories and pet grudges or other baggage we choose to maintain and polish and stay attached to.</p>
<p>In stark contrast to the tendency of the human species, the Creator has never stopped creating new Universes and new Realities, so of course, since the Creator is an infinitely merciful and loving God, He is still creating in and through you, and will continue creating long after anyone who remembers you or anyone you know will be forgotten.</p>

<p>The are just eight simple principles to remember in order to find renewal, recovery and to CONTINOUSLY DEVELOP our lives.</p>
<h1 id="the-eight-principles"><a class="header" href="#the-eight-principles">The Eight Principles</a></h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Realize I'm not God.</strong> I acknowledge that I am fundamentally powerless to control my persistent tendency to rely on my own understanding and capabilities rather than surrendering to divine wisdom. This self-reliance consistently leads me back into destructive patterns and poor decision-making that render my life chaotic and unmanageable. I recognize that my attempts to be the master of my own destiny have repeatedly failed and that the illusion of control has become a barrier to genuine spiritual growth. I must embrace the humbling truth that I am not the author of my own salvation or the architect of lasting change. (Step 1 of 12-step programs) "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven." Matthew 5:3 NIV</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Love God MORE than anything else</strong> [including any church or group of friends or family] and believe that my life matters to Him and, through the power of the Resurrection, that <strong>He has the power to completely restore and even thoroughly re-create me</strong>. I must prioritize my relationship with God above all earthly attachments, recognizing that even good things can become idols when they take precedence over divine communion. Through Christ's resurrection power, I believe that complete transformation is not only possible but promised to those who surrender their lives completely. I commit to releasing my grip on the past and refuse to allow previous failures to define me, while grieving deeply that it has taken me so long to understand that my sole purpose is to glorify God. (Step 2 of 12-step programs) "Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted." Matthew 5:4 NIV</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Earnestly, deliberately, consciously choose to commit ALL my life and will to Christ's care and control</strong>, asking the Holy Spirit to come into my life. This decision requires daily, moment-by-moment surrender of my autonomy to the lordship of Jesus Christ in every area of my existence. I invite the Holy Spirit to take residence in my heart, to guide my thoughts, decisions, and actions according to divine wisdom rather than human reasoning. My life has now become a spiritual battlefield where I must constantly choose between the demands of my ego and the call to humble service, committing to live as a visible example of Christ's transformative power. (Step 3 of 12-step programs) "Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth." Matthew 5:5 NIV</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Openly examine and confess my hurts, hang-ups and habits to myself, to God, and to anyone who cares about the will of the Lord and is able to listen.</strong> I commit to conducting a thorough and honest inventory of my character defects, emotional wounds, and destructive behavioral patterns without minimizing or justifying them. This examination must be done with complete transparency before God and shared with trustworthy individuals who are committed to God's will and possess the spiritual maturity to receive my confession with grace and wisdom. The process of confession breaks the power that secrecy and shame hold over my life while opening me to the healing power of community and accountability that God provides through His people. This ongoing practice of transparency creates space for genuine spiritual growth and prevents the accumulation of hidden resentments and guilt. (Steps 4 and 5 of 12-step programs) "Blessed are the PURE in heart, for they will see God." Matthew 5:8 NIV</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Humbly SUBMIT to ALL changes God wants to make in my life</strong> and voluntarily beg Him to use everything about me, my life, my transformation and my flaws for His purposes. I release all resistance to the divine process of sanctification, even when it requires painful adjustments to my comfort zone or cherished self-image. I actively seek God's intervention in removing character defects that I have been unable to overcome through willpower alone, praying that every aspect of my experience be transformed into instruments for God's glory. I recognize that my transformation is not primarily for my own benefit but for the advancement of God's kingdom and the blessing of others who need to witness His redemptive power. This submission requires daily humility and the willingness to be used in ways that may not align with my personal preferences or timeline. (Steps 6 and 7 of 12-step programs) "Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled." Matthew 5:6 NIV</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Evaluate ALL of my relationships.</strong> I commit to conducting what I will pray is as honest as humanly possible assessment of every relationship in my life, identifying those connections that either support or undermine my spiritual growth and recovery. It will require courage and love, but I will <em>quiet quit</em> on unsupportive, non-Christian relationships and actively distance myself from relationships that enable destructive behaviors while working to eliminate unhealthy dynamics in relationships that can be preserved. I will pray to given the grace of forgiveness to anyone who has wounded me, releasing resentment that would otherwise poison my own spiritual progress, and will make direct amends to individuals I have harmed. This relational inventory becomes an ongoing practice of maintaining healthy boundaries while extending grace to others as God has shown grace to me. (Steps 8 and 9 of 12-step programs) "Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy." Matthew 5:7 NIV "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God." Matthew 5:9 NIV</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Plan, reserve and set aside a DAILY holy time with God for deeper self-examination and Bible reading</strong> and set the stage for being a constant state of prayer throughout the day in order to better know God and His will for my life and to allow Him to shape me to re-gain the creative power to follow His will. I establish a non-negotiable daily appointment with God that includes dedicated time for Scripture reading, prayer, meditation, and honest reflection on my spiritual condition and growth. This protected time with God serves as the spiritual foundation that influences every other hour of my day, creating a consciousness of His presence that transforms ordinary moments into opportunities for worship and guidance. I cultivate the discipline of practicing God's presence throughout my daily activities while allowing Scripture to renew my thinking patterns and align my values with eternal rather than temporal priorities. This daily spiritual discipline strengthens my ability to recognize God's voice, discern His will, and respond with immediate obedience to His promptings. (Steps 10 and 11 of 12-step programs)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Yield myself completely to God to be used to bring this Good News to others, primarily by my example and not just my words.</strong> I surrender my life to become a living testimony of God's transformative power, understanding that my authentic change speaks louder than any testimony I might offer verbally. I commit to living with such integrity and love that others are naturally curious about the source of the joy, peace, and purpose they observe in my daily conduct. I actively seek opportunities to serve and encourage others who are struggling, building genuine relationships with hurting people while allowing God's love to flow through my actions, attitudes, and availability. I accept that living as a faithful witness may result in persecution from those threatened by authentic spiritual transformation, but find deep satisfaction knowing my life can serve as a beacon of hope for others trapped in the same destructive patterns that once defined my existence. (Step 12 of 12-step programs) "Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven." Matthew 5:10 NIV</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Stop looking back; stop catastrophizing about what might happen. CHOOSE NOW.</strong> <em><strong>Let the dead bury their dead.</strong></em> Stop waiting for others to change, stop waiting for the world to change, stop waiting for the church to change, stop waiting for your family to change, stop waiting for your friends to change.</p>

<p>As you improve your spiritual fitness, you will become much, MUCH less anxious ... long-term massive reductions in anxiety is one way of knowing whether or not your approach is working, ie it's NOT like the bs euphoria you might feel when you go to some EPIC retreat or have some life-changing experience, eg almost dying, -- it's a permanent, long-term MASSIVE reduction in anxiety ... and with freedom from anxiety, comes the ability to get off the damned hamster wheel and the ability to make smarter, more stable decisions and to do less blatantly stupid physical stuff, ie like use a drink to relax OR swallow food to be some sort of social/emotional crutch OR think that you need a vacation.</p>

GOD NEVER WENT ON VACATION and He never will. You were created in God's image ... that means embrace the SUCK, embrace the disappoint from humans, embrace the humility ... embrace being unappreciated or taken for granted, because humans CANNOT understand the nature of God.</a></h4>
<p>That's what the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ was about. Christian spiritual health forms the cornerstone of holistic wellbeing, influencing all other aspects of life through prayer, scripture engagement, and spiritual practices.

<p><strong>Most of the gains comes from what you remove in order sculpt the perfect life intended by your Creator. It can at times seems tedious, repetitive, even painful and tough to do, but much of creating is about the discipline of being optimistic and ready to exploit new opportunities, ie <em>being stoked</em>, ditching the hate, forgiving sin, letting go of attachments and moving forward without the distractions ... while you steadily, patiently call out the noisemakers and REMOVE THE NOISE.</strong></p>
<p>Listening to your life as you live your life is about <em><strong>really KNOWING and trying to BE your very most essential WHY</strong></em> ... not the stupid bullshit you have picked up along the way ... really understanding the UNIQUE reason for your existence ... it's about <em><strong>trying to understand the ONE Origin of your most original origins</strong></em>.</p>
<p>The Ancient Guy lifestyle eschews comfort, adopting a purely ascetic lifestyle and renounce other materialist pursuits in order to free one's mind from distractions, to be able to spend more time in contemplation of the Creator's will, to practice more intuitive remote viewing and to developed more advanced cognitive capabilities that are possible only through prayer.</p>
<h3 id="stop-ever-blaming-others"><a class="header" href="#stop-ever-blaming-others">Stop EVER Blaming Others</a></h3>
<p>Forgive, let go of all attachments to emotions, stop allowing people to pile their drama upon you ... move forward trying to be more present in the moment ... stop multitasking; instead focus more intently on what you must accomplish first, right now to make you better able to accomplish things in future. Instead of worrying, just focus on the questions like "What's my goal for the next half hour or hour or next few hours? What do I most need to accomplish today? How have I timeblocked my day ... but MOSTLY stop ever blaming others ... <em>when you tend your garden of HATE, it will take over every last thing that you possess.</em> <em><strong>Stop EVER Blaming Others!</strong></em></p>
<h3 id="cultivate-the-living-garden-of-your-mind"><a class="header" href="#cultivate-the-living-garden-of-your-mind">Cultivate The <em>LIVING Garden</em> of Your Mind</a></h3>
<p>The soul comes first. Our spiritual existence is eternal, so one must place a priority on one's spiritual existence.</p>
<p>However, being able to contemplate a healthier spiritual existence in this life is possible only when one's mind is free from worry, fear, anxiety, drama and other negative emotions which detract from our spiritual focus and Love of God. <em><strong>IN ORDER TO FOCUS ON THE SOUL</strong></em>, it is necessary to cultivate the healthier <em>living garden</em> of one's mind to be able to feed the soul.</p>
<p>Your MIND is the only place in this life that you have to live.</p>
<p>Take better care of your mind. REFUSE to allow others to dump their drama pollution upon your, but don't hate them for being filled worry, fear, anxiety ... they simply don't know any better ... this is ANOTHER reason why we must <em><strong>Stop EVER Blaming Others!</strong></em> but the FIRST reason is that IDIOTS do not get to live rent-free in one's mind.</p>

<p>A healthier body supports the mind.</p>
<p>It's tough to have much of life that isn't about pain and the suffering and anxieties that comes from knowing the future is nothing but pain if one doesn't take care of one body. This does not change the inescapable Reality that your mind is the only place in this existence that you have to live. In order to <em><strong>cultivate the living garden of one's mind</strong></em> it is necessary to protect and sustain that living garden with a physical temple ... your body is that temple, that physical edifice that houses your mind.</p>

<p>*EVENTUALLY, one finally realizes that the ONLY decent use of life is prayer ... or being in a constant state of prayer and sustaining a constant meditative awareness so that one is able to <strong>pray without ceasing.</strong></p>
<p>The state of <em>being in prayer without ceasing</em> is the IDEAL ... it's unlikely, probably impossible for you to ever get there ... because your affluent existence has PROGRAMMED YOU to be driven by materialism and material distractions ... like your assets, your moneypit house, you stupid vehicle to take you to your dumbass distractions ... so, as a programmed affluent gadget, programmed to take cues from the material world, you can only dream of being in a perfect state of praying without ceasing.</p>
<p>Of course, one does not need ANY the other CRAP that is part of our affluent existence ... but [if one cares about one's soul] one really needs to be able to TRY TO get to the state of prayer without ceasing ... to live meditatively, to be in a constant state of prayer ... to be something approaching a constant state of meditative awareness.</p>
<h3 id="meditative-awareness"><a class="header" href="#meditative-awareness">Meditative AWARENESS</a></h3>
<p>There are several types of prayerful meditation and strategies for greater cognitive awareness that have been practiced by monks and spiritual practitioners across various traditions throughout the ages. Some of the prominent or effective approaches ... not necessarily, in order of importance, ie <em>try all of them and others; use whatever ploy seems to work for you.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Devotional Meditation: Devotional meditation focuses on some core principle or idea cultivating a deeper sense of love, humility or surrender, and an openness to more direct connection ... to emphasize our complete devotion a higher, more deeply spiritual Reality. Practitioners tend to engage in prayer centered around a devotional topic in order to cultivate a stronger feeling of the presence of God, to open hearts and experience a sense of divine union.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mindfulness Meditation: Mindfulness meditation involves focusing on the present moment with a non-judgmental awareness. Concentration meditation aims to develop single-pointed focus and mental stability. Practitioners choose an object of attention, typically the breath because it is something that is always present wherever one might be and train their mind to remain steadily absorbed in just the breath and breathing. By emptying the mind of all arising thoughts and returing focus the breath and breathing, this practice cultivates better mental discipline throughout the day which lead to deeper states of calm, clarity, and equanimity. This type of meditation helps develop clarity, stability, and insight into the nature of reality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compassion Meditation: Compassion meditation focuses on cultivating feelings of love, compassion, and goodwill towards oneself and others. Practitioners visualize or contemplate the struggles of others and generate a heartfelt wish for the well-being of others and their freedom from pains, fears, anxieties, delusions. Practitioners silently repeat phrases of well-wishing, such as "Show me how I can genuinely help so that all can be happier and freer from suffering." This is NOT a matter of practicing idiot compassion and searching for charities to write checks to ... compassion is what we can DO, it's not about virtue signalling or guilt alleviations. The compassion meditatation practice is about earnestly wishing to create a stronger sense of empathy, forgiveness, and love for others ... to especially be more PRESENT for those around us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Body Awareness [All Sensations, Including Pain] Meditation: Practitioners try to intensify their attention to a particular bodily sensations, as well as thoughts and emotions that arise out of these sensations without getting caught up in them. This practice can extend to unpleastant sensations, such as pain, and can help practitioners develop a greater sense of equanimity and acceptance in the face of physical discomfort. It important to point out that this practice does not alleviate pain and it's not about trying to ignore or suppress or "think away" pain, but rather it is about trying to coldly, calmly observe the sensation and thoughts that arise out of the sensation with a sense of curiosity and openness ... this cultivates a better informed [because one is actually paying attention RATHER than running away in fear], more practically compassionate and active attitude towards one's own suffering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open Awareness Meditation: Open awareness meditation, also known as "just sitting," but it can also be "just waiting in line" or "just stopped in traffic" as it involves trying to be hyperaware of what one's is doing and one's surroundings ... but, it is about dipensing with other distractions, ie with a thought that might be something like, "That's fine, princess, but I'm NOT going to think about that RIGHT NOW!" It's important to stress that resting the mind in this way is about being more aware of one's surroundings and the situation one is in. Resting the mind refers to dispensing with all distractions or daydreams or things that pop into one's head ... one is fixated on the situation at hand and NOT UPON some passing thought OR focusing on any particular object or experience. Practically, if one is enduring some sort of anxiety attack or being overcome with some sort of worry/fear, the only exception might be on recentering focus on one's breath and one's breathing. Practitioners maintain a broad, spacious, situational attentiveness to whatever might arise in the present moment in one's surroundings ... this is inherently restful, but but one finds that one is also ready to be more present for others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Movement Meditation: Movement meditation incorporates mindful physical practices, such as hiking meditation, yoga, or martial arts solo exercises. By bringing full awareness to the mechanics of the form of the exercise, to different parts of body in motion, practitioners cultivate a sense of presence, grace, and unity between mind and body ... but MOSTLY movement mediations is about JUST DOING IT RIGHT ... when one walks, one focuses on walking RIGHT -- studying everything about the gait, how the body feels, what could be better, but the focus is on walking RIGHT, ie NOT on a podcast or on the day ahead, but JUST on walking RIGHT. The discipline from this practice should carry over to other movements and activities throughout the day ... for example, when climbs and descends stairs, one focuses on JUST climbing and descending the stairs in the most efficient and safest manner possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Analytic or Reading Meditation: This is about EARNESTLY seeking to undertand a concept that is being presented. It might involve reading a book, working through a paper with code/data, reviewing open source software code or any sort of activity in which is necessary to understand a concept RATHER than casting one's own biases, assumptions, past history on top of the concept, eg it's NOT IMPORTANT that you did something like this in the 90s!!! What matters is trying to REALLY understand the author's p;point of view. Analytic meditation can also involve contemplating specific scientific, mathematic philosophical or theological CONCEPTS, from different perspectives, different authors to gain deeper insight and understanding of the concept. This practice is really more about mental self-control than it is about meditation; they point of being intently focused on seeking first to understand is about develop critical thinking skills and even more CRITICAL LISTENING SKILLS, which are necessary for a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gratitude Meditation: Gardening OR Cooking OR Household Chores OR Home Maintenance. Minimalize, but take care of what you have. Be PRESENT. Gardening OR cooking meditation incorporates mindful practices, like walking meditation or analytic mediation but it incorporates a the accomplishment of a task in a manner that does not cause noise or create similar negative externalities ... it should be something that something that one needs to do anyway, but something one can do with passion and as well as humanly possible ... if the meditative task is one that one does not particularly enjoy at all, like housecleaning, one can try to make it more meditative and more enjoyable by focusing speed or efficiency of movement or how much one can accomplish in fifteen minutes. The discipline from meditatively doing tasks one does not particularly love should carry over to other activities throughout the year, eg doing taxes, cleaning out the garage, etc.... this form of meditation is mainly just on this list in order to allow for changing up one's practice ... there's nothing especially sacred about the repition of just words or sounds ... the POINT is use something, other than one's breath or breathing, in order to re-center and re-focus on JUST BEING PRESENT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quote or Mantra Meditation: Mantra, Quote-, Word- or Verse-of-the-Day meditation involves the repetition of a chosen word, phrase, or sound, either silently or aloud. The repetition of something like a favorite Bible verse serves as an anchor for the mind, helping to quiet mental chatter and to generally <em>cultivate</em> a sense of inner stillness and connection to the divine ... but this form of meditation is mainly just on this list in order to allow for changing up one's practice ... there's nothing especially sacred about the repition of just words or sounds ... the POINT is use something, other than one's breath or breathing, in order to re-center and re-focus on JUST BEING PRESENT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chore Meditation: The information security chore of changing passwords presents an opportunity to work on memorizing new passwords based upon new top-ten list as mnemonics, eg use 8.D.O.W.N.T.I.M.E.8 to eliminate waste. Changing passwords is something that you'll need to do anyway ... this is not a great meditation practice, but it is a way to make repetitive memorization more enjoyable and to make a game out of it. To some extent, cognitive strategy awareness is about making a game out of the little things that one should remember ... this form of meditation is mainly just on this list in order to allow for changing up one's practice ... there's nothing especially sacred about the repition of just words or sounds ... the POINT is use something, other than one's breath or breathing, in order to re-center and re-focus on JUST BEING PRESENT.</p>
