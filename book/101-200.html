<h3 id="0-listen-to-yourself"><a class="header" href="#0-listen-to-yourself">0. LISTEN TO YOURSELF!</a></h3>
<p>Your body, your mind, your soul are attempting to repeat what God is trying to tell your old, fossilized ass. LISTEN TO YOURSELF! Mostly, your soul has to come first. Understand what this means for you; take time to contemplate ways that make you pay attention to your SOUL ... <em>some guys need time in prison to accomplish this feat</em> ... hopefully, you won't need that. But if you consistenly put yourself and your pile of assets, relationships, acquistions first, then you will belong in prison. Remember where <strong>J-O-Y</strong> comes from. J is for Jesus, FIRST! Then O for Other principles, Other causes, maybe the Oath you took to support and defend the Constitution, Y is for You and me -- <em>love all humans as you love yourself</em>, but humans come AFTER your Creator, AFTER higher principles. Internalize <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/8/Mark-chapter-8.html">Mark 8:34-38</a> and stop trifling away your life chasing wealth, power, status or even more idiotic human pursuits such as being <em>liked</em> by nice humans. After your soul, care for your MIND -- it does NOT need to relax; it NEEDS the aggravation of growth, the challenge of learning. Stop looking back! Time does not work that way. Instead of being an irrelevant senile geezer longing for the rearview mirror, try to LEARN as much as you can in order to grow. Try to NOT be just another OLD fossilized, ecocentric <em>specialist,</em> taking pride in your professional reputation ... <em>nobody cares about your reputation -- they will and should care even less when you make an issue of defending it</em>. Finally, listen to your BODY; loving your body means USING it; your body knows why "Discipline Equals Freedom." It's time for you to ignore fitness gadgets or apps, and LISTEN in order to develop your body awareness. Of course, extreme minimalism bordering on austere asceticism will help you to listen, because if you really want to listen to yourself, it is important to <strong>remove all of the materialist noise!</strong></p>

Focusing on the fundamentals of how a SYSTEM, rather than a secret sauce, delivers consistent proven returns. Avoiding fads, trends and things that the conventional wisdom believes to be the next big thing. Invest in the boring, underappreciated, seemingly trite patient discipline of diligent inquiry to understand the difficult matters of being able to execute getting hard things dones and delivering better outcomes and laying foundations for larger opportunities for boring organic growth. Become an advocate for continuous, small-scale progress that has the potential to scale to everyman, rather than the sudden leaps or gee-whiz kewl stuff.</p>
